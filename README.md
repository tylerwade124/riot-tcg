##
I am creating an index similar to the pokedex, for league of legends characters. Currently there are 161 characters, and I plan to create a tcg style card for the characters.

##
First step is to find the league of legends characters API
###
The LOL characters api - http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/12.19.1/data/en_US/champion.json

##
Then pull the data from the API into javascript file

##
take the usable json data from the api, and implement the data into cards on the screen

##
implement a search bar, to find each champion
###
or have a small clickable icon, and when you hover over the icon with your mouse, it shows you the card magnified
